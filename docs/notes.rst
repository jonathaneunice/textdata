Notes
=====

* Those who like how ``textdata`` simplifies data extraction from
  text should also consider `quoter <https://pypi.org/project/quoter>`_,
  a module with the same philosophy about wrapping text and
  joining composite data into strings.

* Automated multi-version testing managed with the wonderful
  `pytest <https://pypi.org/project/pytest>`_,
  `pytest-cov <https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov>`_,
  `coverage <https://pypi.org/project/coverage>`_,
  and `tox <https://pypi.org/project/tox>`_.
  Continuous integration testing
  with `Travis-CI <https://travis-ci.org/jonathaneunice/textdata>`_.
  Packaging linting with `pyroma <https://pypi.org/project/pyroma>`_.

* Successfully packaged for, and tested against, all late-model versions of
  Python: 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 pre-release, as well as recent
  versions of PyPy and PyPy3.
