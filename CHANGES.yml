  version: 1.6.0
  date: September 1, 2015
  notes: >
    Added ``textline()`` routine (NB ``textline`` not ``textlines``)
    as a quick "grab a single very long line" function.  It actually
    allows multiple paragraphs to be grabbed, each as a single long
    line, separated by double-newlines (i.e. Markdown style).

-
  version: 1.5.0
  date: September 1, 2015
  notes: >
    Added ``text()`` as preferred synonym for ``textlines()``, as that
    is more consistent with the rest of the naming scheme. Deprecated
    ``textlines()``.

    Misc. changes from 1.0 or prior:
    
    Common line prefix is now computed without considering blank
    lines, so blank lines need not have any indentation on them
    just to "make things work."

    The tricky case where all lines have a common prefix, but it's
    not entirely composed of whitespace, now properly handled.
    This is useful for lines that are already "quoted" such as
    with leading ``"|"`` or ``">"`` symbols (common in Markdown
    and old-school email usage styles).

    ``textlines()`` is now somewhat superfluous, now that ``lines()``
    has a ``join`` kwarg.  But you may prefer it for the implicit
    indication that it's turning lines into text.
