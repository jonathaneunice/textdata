        Removed ``print()`` inadvertently added in last release.

    version: 2.3.0
    date: September 15, 2018
    notes: >
        Changed tab handling behavior. Previously used ``str.expandtabs()``
        uniformly. While useful for dedent (removing common line indentation),
        could obscure important internal tabs. Default behavior is now to NOT
        expandtabs unless explicitly requested. However, leading tabs are still
        expanded for dedent processing.

    version: 2.2.0
    date: July 7, 2018
    notes: >
        Reorganized code. Tidied and improved comments.

        Improved key cleaning for ``records()``

        Added ``full`` evaluation mode.

        Strengthened table evaluations.

        Improved tests and docs.

        Dropped deprecated ``astype`` and ``literal`` parameters to ``attrs()``.

        Drops support for Python 2.6. Mainstream support ended 5 years ago. Upgrade already!

-
    version: 2.1.0
    date: July 4, 2018
    notes: >
        Removed debugging statement inadverntaently left in code.

        Improve documentation, esp. for APIs.

        Enable ``attrs``, ``table``, and ``records`` to take the same string or sequence
        of lines input as the outher routines.

        Cleaned up exported names. ``OrderedDict`` no longer exported as a convenience.

        *Major* release.

        Added ``table()`` and ``records()`` functions for
        ingesting tabular and record-oriented data respectively.\

        Regularized handling of object evaluation, comment stripping,
        and other attributes.

    version: 1.7.3
    date: October 13, 2017
    notes: >
        Added pyproject.toml for PEP 518 compliance.

        Updated testing matrix to accomodate new PyPy3 version
        on Travis CI.

    version: 1.7.2
    date: May 30, 2017
    notes: >
        Update compatibility strategy to make Python 3 centric.
        Python 2 is now the outlier. More future-proof.

        Doc tweaks.


-
    version: 1.7.1
    date: January 30, 2017
    notes: >
        Returned test coverage to 100% of lines (introducing
        `attrs()` took it briefly down to 99% testing).

-
    version: 1.7.0
    date: January 30, 2017
    notes: >
        Added `attrs()` function for parsing `dict` instances
        out of text.

-
    version: 1.6.2
    date: January 23, 2017
    notes: >
        Updates testing. Newly qualified under 2.7.13 and 3.6,
        as well as most recent builds of pypy and pypy3.

-
  version: 1.6.1
  date: September 15, 2015
  notes: >
    Added Python 3.5.0 final and PyPy 2.6.1 to the testing matrix.

-
  version: 1.6.0
  date: September 1, 2015
  notes: >
    Added ``textline()`` routine (NB ``textline`` not ``textlines``)
    as a quick "grab a single very long line" function.  It actually
    allows multiple paragraphs to be grabbed, each as a single long
    line, separated by double-newlines (i.e. Markdown style).

-
  version: 1.5.0
  date: September 1, 2015
  notes: >
    Added ``text()`` as preferred synonym for ``textlines()``, as that
    is more consistent with the rest of the naming scheme. Deprecated
    ``textlines()``.

-
  version: 1.4.3
  date: August 26, 2015
  notes: >
    Reorganizes documentation using Sphinx.

-
  version: 1.4.2
  date: August 17, 2015
  notes: >
    Achieves 100% test coverage. Updated testing scheme to automatically
    evaluate and report combined coverage across multiple Python versions.

-
  version: 1.4.0
  date: null
  notes: Allows all routines to accept a list of text lines, in addition
    to text as a single string.

-
  version: 1.0

  notes: >
    Misc. changes from 1.0 or prior:

    Common line prefix is now computed without considering blank
    lines, so blank lines need not have any indentation on them
    just to "make things work."

    The tricky case where all lines have a common prefix, but it's
    not entirely composed of whitespace, now properly handled.
    This is useful for lines that are already "quoted" such as
    with leading ``"|"`` or ``">"`` symbols (common in Markdown
    and old-school email usage styles).

    ``textlines()`` is now somewhat superfluous, now that ``lines()``
    has a ``join`` kwarg.  But you may prefer it for the implicit
    indication that it's turning lines into text.
